## Motivation

---

- The main purpose of this study is to develop a forecasting model od rainfall using RC and to investigate the possible factors in governing the rainfall forecast in the southern Taiwan. to the best of our knowlidge, this is the first study that rainfall is forecasted by using RC. In summary, we present the direct evidence for the system performance and the effect to rainfall prediction.

## Method

---

- calculate RMSE, Normalized RMSE, correlation coefficient from the observed precipitation and the predicted value.
- Compare with the commercial software (MATLAB) models to verify their models' feasibility.
- Calculate metrics such that probability of detection (POD), false alarm ratio (FAR) and threat score (TS).
- Data of two observation stations including seven parameters.
  - air pressure
  - humidity
  - wind speed
  - wind direction
  - precipitation
  - sea level
