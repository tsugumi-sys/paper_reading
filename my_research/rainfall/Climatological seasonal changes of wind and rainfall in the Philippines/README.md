# Motivation
Some paper shows the relationships between seasonal changes and rainfalls in Philippines, however the seasonal transactions between NE and SW monsoons have not been described well. This paer aimed to describe the seasonal changes in the lower tropospheric winds (monsoons) and rainfalls based on temporally small scale data (5-day mean data).

# Method
| Data | Data Source | Grid Resolution (degree) |
| -------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| 7 Daily rainfall data | TRMM3B42 | 0.25 |
| Wind data | ECMWF | 0.75 | 
| Typhoon Tracking | JTWC | |

Calcualte 5 days mean of rainfall and 850 hpa wind for the 16 years from 1 (Jan. 1-5) to 73 (Dec. 27-31).



# Insight

## Climatological features of rainfall and low level circulation.
Seasonal transactions between NE and SW monsoons has been showned. The monsoon direction is changing around May and June. Also rainfall area is changing accordingly.

## Spatial contrasting features of rainfall and low level circulation along the west and east coasts.
An abrupt change of wind regime from the easterly to westerly monsoon is obvious in mid-May over most part the Philippines except in the south area. However the rainfall is start increasing before the monsoon change recently (simoutaneously in the past) when TCs (Tropical cyclone?) are located near the Philippines.

The reversal of rainfalls and winds are more clear in the northern area than that in southern area because higher mountains are in north area.





# Contribution Summary
Climatological  seasonal changes f rainfall and lower tropospheric circulation in the Philippines are analyed by pentad means of rainfall and 850-hPa wind fields data. It is found that the grand onset of SW
monsoon occurs abruptly in mid-May almost simutaneously over the Philippines expect in the southern region south of 8N where westerly monsoon arrives earlier by approcimately 2 pentads in early May. After the mid-May grand onset, SW monsoon starts from the north in the Philippines. The slight defference of onset between sudden rainfall increase and monsoonal wind shift is newly found in this study. The defference observed in the long-term climatology are mainly attributed to the TC influences before the summer monsoon onset.


# Keyword
- SW Monsoon is south west monsoon in summer in Philippines.

- NE monsoon is north east monsoon in winter in Philippines.
