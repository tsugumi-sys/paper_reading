# Motivation
Some paper shows the relationships between seasonal changes and rainfalls in Philippines, however the seasonal transactions between NE and SW monsoons have not been described well. This paer aimed to describe the seasonal changes in the lower tropospheric winds (monsoons) and rainfalls based on temporally small scale data (5-day mean data).

# Method
| Data | Data Source | Grid Resolution (degree) |
| -------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| 7 Daily rainfall data | TRMM3B42 | 0.25 |
| Wind data | ECMWF | 0.75 | 
| Typhoon Tracking | JTWC | |

Calcualte 5 days mean of rainfall and 850 hpa wind for the 16 years from 1 (Jan. 1-5) to 73 (Dec. 27-31).



# Insight

## Climatological features of rainfall and low level circulation.
Seasonal transactions between NE and SW monsoons has been showned. The monsoon direction is changing around May and June. Also rainfall area is changing accordingly.

## Spatial contrasting features of rainfall and low level circulation along the west and east coasts.
An abrupt change of wind regime from the easterly to westerly monsoon is obvious in mid-May over most part the Philippines except in the south area. However the rainfall is start increasing before the monsoon change recently (simoutaneously in the past) when TCs (Tropical cyclone?) are located near the Philippines.

The reversal of rainfalls and winds are more clear in the northern area than that in southern area because higher mountains are in north area.





# Contribution Summary

- NE monsoon is north east monsoon in winter in Philippines.
