## Motivation

---

- This study investigate the predictability of RJJ18 by ensemble forecasts using the NEXTRA system. They focus on the predictablity of the third stage, in which most western prefectures experienced disastorus heavy rainfall.
- Thay discuss the synoptic-scale predictability of RJJ18 using a relatively coarse global DA system at 112km horizontal resolution.
- It is also important to investigate impacts of assimilated observations to forecast error reductions as in the previous studies by e.g., Wu et al. (2010), Jung et al. (2012), and Kunii et al. (2012) for The Observing System Research and Predictability Experiment’s Pacific Asian Regional Campaign.

## Method

---

- NICAM
  - 112km horizontal scale resolution with 38 vertical layers up to approximatery 40 km.
  - Ensembele 100 members predictions (mean value).
- LETKF
  - the LETKF conducts DA every 6h.
  - The assimilated observations are conventional observations from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) operational system, satellite radiances of Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A and a near-real-time version of Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation.

## Insight

---

- Ensemble-mean 24-h accumulated precipitation forecasts on 6 July 2018 were almost the same as JMA’s observation after 0000 UTC 4 July; namely, the intense precipitation over the WJ domain was well predicted 3 days in advance. DA at 1200 UTC 3 July and 0000 UTC 4 July contributed substantially to improving predictions of heavy rainfall. The predictability of the intense rains was tied to the generation of a low-pressure system LNoto in the middle of the Baiu front.
