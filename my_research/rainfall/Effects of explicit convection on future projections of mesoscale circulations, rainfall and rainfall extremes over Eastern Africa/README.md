## Motivation

---

- To improve representation of convection support or conflict with projections by parameterized convection, for total, extreme and frequency of rainfalls across the hugely varied climatic zones of eastern Africa.
- To get deeper understanding of the drivers of rainfall changes provide confidence in the projections.
- To understand how the rainfall coupling or lack of coupling to atmospheric flows such as the see breeze affect rainfall projections in two models.

## Method

---

- Analysis here used data archived from the simulations at hourly or 3-hourly frequency, with the exception of the integrated subgrid vertical mass flux, which has been postprocessed as a vertical column integral from monthly mean model level data and saturation vapor pressure, which has been postprocessed from hourly instantaneous 1.5m temperature.
- The global model provides lateral boundary conditions to the reginal model and use same sea surface temperature dataset over the years 1997-2007.
- convection-permitting regional model (CP4) has convection parameterization with higher vertical resolution.
- parameterized convection regional model (P25) is a simulation model that has the same grid spacing as the global driving model (approximately 26km in latitude by 39km in longitude at the equator.)
