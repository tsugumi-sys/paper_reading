## Motivation

---

- To understand the changes of rainfall pattern around east africa and other methodological parameters.

## Method

---

## Insight

---

- The anomalously wet conditions continued after the normal end of the short rains in December into January 2020. The may be related to the persistence of the warm SST anomaly in the western Indian Ocean. The warm SST anomaly in the western Indian Ocean persisted throughout January 2020.
- Future projections from climate models indicate increasing raindall during the short rains under future climate (Rowell et al., 2015), suggesting that events such as the increased rainfall during the 2019 short rains could become more frequent under climate change.
- Furthermore, recent work has shown that climate change can also increase the intensity if rain in storms over Africa because global warming increases the saturation vapour pressure and so potentially the total column water and storm intensities (Kendon et al. 2019; Fenny et al., 2020).
- Cai et al. (2018) concluded that under a global average warming of 1.5 degC (above pre-industrial level) strongly positive IOD events may occur twicw as often.
- The rate of recent warming of the western Indian Ocean is one of the fastest of any tropical ocean over the last century (Roxy et al., 2014) and climate models project that contnuation of these higher rates of warming should be expected under climate change (Zeng et al., 2013, Chu et al., 2014).
