## Motivation

---

- Taiwan is located in the subtropics off the south-eastern coast of China. Its climate is strongly affected by the East Asian monsoons. And the presence of the Central Mountain Range causes large spatial variations in the island.
- To undarstand the chearactaristics of raindalls in Taiwan from available data.

## Method

---

- 2.5 * 2.5 (angle) European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)/Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere (TOGA) data during 1988-1997.

## Insight

---

- **Winter: October to December**
  - For most stations along the nothern, northeastern, and eastern coasts of Taiwan, the daily rainfall accumulation decreases rapidly from late October to December. The decrease in rainfall along the windward coasts during this period is related to the southeastward extension of the ridge axis from central China to the Taiwan area and the decrease in both the moisture content and stability.
- **Winter: February to April**
  - The rainfall frequenceies for light rain rates along the northeastern and northern coasts decrease from more than 60% in February to less than 40% in late April as the winter monsoon cold surges become infrequent.
  - With the establishment of the southwesterly flow at the 850-hPa level and the weaking of the northeasterly monsoon flow in the lowest levels over Taiwan, the orographic lifting becomes less significant there.
- **Spring: May to June**
  - Most stations recorded largest bimonthly daily rainfall during the peak of the mei-yu (May to June) season.
  - The higher rainfall during the second half of the mei-yu season than during the first half to a warmer southwesterly monsoon flow with a much higher moisture content as the season progress.
- **Summer: mid-July to late August**
  - The atmospheric stratification over Taiwan is potentially unstable during the summer months under the preveiling southwesterly monsoon flow, which brings in warm, moist maritime air from the south.
  - The low-level moist static energy reaches its annual maximum and the precipitable water over Taiwan also reaches an annual maximum in August.
- **Autumn: September to October**
  - The transition fromthe southwesterly monsoon to the northeasterly monsoon over Taiwan occurs in early September, during which time the late summer monsoon through retreats southward from its northernmost position in late Argust.
  - The climatological rainfall pattern during September-October shows that orographic effects are important in determining the horizontal rainfall distributiion.

## Contribution Summary

---

- The horizontal distributions of climatological rainfall patterns for different rainfall regimes are strongly dependent on the direction of the low-level prevailing flow with much higher rainfall on the wind-ward side of the Central Mountain Range.
- The seasonal variations in rainfall amount and type (light precipitation vs convective precipitation) are also dependent on the thermodynamic stratification and the availability of moisture.
