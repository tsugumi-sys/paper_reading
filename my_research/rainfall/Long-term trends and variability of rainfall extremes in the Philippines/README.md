# Motivation
This paper forcuses on investigating the trends of raindall extreames and relationships between ENSO, PDO and extream rainfalls on a seasonal perspective which is still unknown.


# Method
| Data | Data Source |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Daily rainfall data of 1951-2010 | PAGASA |
| 35 station rainfall data | JAMSTEC |
| Sea ica and sea surface temperature | HadISST1 |
| 850hpa Wind field |  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |

| Index Name | description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| P95 | 95th percentile of wet days |
| RX1day | Maximum 1-day rainfall |
| RX5day | Maximum 5-day rainfall |
| PCPTOT | Seasonal wet days total rainfall |
| P95d   | Count of days exceeding the base period's P95 |
| LWS    | Maximum length of wet spell |
| LDS    | Maximum length of dry spell |
| JFM | January-March |
| AMJ | April-June |
| JAS | July-September |
| OND | October-December |

To examining trends, they used Mann-Kendall (MK) test with the moving blocks bootstrapping (MBB) to consider the autocorrelation in a time series.

# Insight


# Contribution Summary

## Keyword
- ENSO (El Nino-Southern Oscillation), is an irregular periodic variation in winds and sea surface temperatures over the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean.

- EPI (extreme precipitation indices)

- PDO (Pacific Decadal Oscillation) is a robust, recurring pattern of ocean-atmosphere climate variability centered over the mid-latitude Pacific ocean.
