## Motivation

This paper forcuses on investigating the trends of raindall extreames and relationships between ENSO, PDO and extream rainfalls on a seasonal perspective which is still unknown.

## Method

| Data | Data Source |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Daily rainfall data of 1951-2010 | PAGASA |
| 35 station rainfall data | JAMSTEC |
| Sea ica and sea surface temperature | HadISST1 |
| 850hpa Wind field |  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |

| Index Name | description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| P95 | 95th percentile of wet days |
| RX1day | Maximum 1-day rainfall |
| RX5day | Maximum 5-day rainfall |
| PCPTOT | Seasonal wet days total rainfall |
| P95d   | Count of days exceeding the base period's P95 |
| LWS    | Maximum length of wet spell |
| LDS    | Maximum length of dry spell |
| JFM | January-March |
| AMJ | April-June |
| JAS | July-September |
| OND | October-December |

To examining trends, they used Mann-Kendall (MK) test with the moving blocks bootstrapping (MBB) to consider the autocorrelation in a time series.
And count number of EPI (PCPTOT, RX1(5)day, P95(d), LWS, WDS) of the each stations.

## Insight

From EPI scores of each seasons (JFM ~ OND) over 60 years, the paper found drying tendency during dry season (JFM) and a wetting condition during wet season (JAS).

On the longer scale (1911~2010), RX5day is decreasing trend in the north area, on the other hand, increasing trend in the middle sea area. The decreasing trend of the north area can be because of the extension of the WNPSH (high pressure). Some spatially bigger change affects the rainfalls of Philippines.

When El Nino is strong, the western area in Philippiness get more rainfall in wet season (JAS) but get less rainfall in other season. However, the northern or eastern area get more rainfall when La Nina is strong.

## Contribution Summary

This study serach the long-term trend and variaty of rainfall extreams in Philippines trough EPI. Signifivantry dry trends during JFM, on the other hand, wetting tendency in the western and ccentral area during JAS. From 4 station data for 60 years, the rainfall trends is the part of some long-term trends. WNPSH may cause the EPI trend in JAS, while the weaking of the East Asian monsoon affect the trends during JFM. In more larger scale, ENSO affects the EPI trends. The results shows EN (LN) events are associated with statistically significant drier (wetter) conditions.

## Keyword

- ENSO (El Nino-Southern Oscillation), is an irregular periodic variation in winds and sea surface temperatures over the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean.

- LN is La Nina.

- EPI (extreme precipitation indices)

- PDO (Pacific Decadal Oscillation) is a robust, recurring pattern of ocean-atmosphere climate variability centered over the mid-latitude Pacific ocean.

- PDO Index is a index value of PDO.

- WNPSH the western North Pacific subtropical high

## Unknown

ENSO variability at longer timescales and its potential influence on EPI in the Philippines requires thorough analyses that should be relegated to a separate paper focusing only on this aspect; thus, this is left for the future research.

## Reflection

The rainfalls of Philippiness has seasonal change and also affects by more big event like ENSO.
