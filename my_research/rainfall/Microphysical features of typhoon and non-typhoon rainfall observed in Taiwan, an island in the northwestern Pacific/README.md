## Contribution Summary

Raindrop size distributions (RSDs) of typhoon (TY) and non-typhoon (NTY) rainy days have been analyzed using long-term (2004–2016) disdrometer measurements from northern Taiwan. Besides disdrometer data, other auxiliary data sets (remote sensing, reanalysis, and ground-based radar) have been used to discuss the disparities in RSDs between TY and NTY rainfall. The NTY days have more very large-sized drops and fewer small-sized drops than TY days, resulting in larger Dm and smaller Nw values on NTY days. The mean normalized RSD of NTY precipitation has a higher occurrence of larger drops (at D/Dm>2) than TY precipitation, which indicates the possibility of diverse microphysical processes between these two weather conditions

- RSD:: Raindrop size distribution (雨粒粒度分布): The distribution of the number of raindrops according to their diameter.
- Convectional rainfall: a type of rainfall that involves the formation of cnovection currents.
- Stratiform rainfall: large air masses rise diagonally as larger-scale atmospheric dynamics force them to move over each other.
